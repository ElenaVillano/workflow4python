# Workshop: Workflow for Python

#### By Elena Villalobos Nolasco 


### Objective: 

To show you good practices and reproducibility when working with Python.

### Repo structure:

Look for the lessons in the docs folder.

### PYTHONPATH 

```
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD
```


### Vagrant machine

If you don't want to mess up your setup, you can try all of this on a virtual machine:

```
vagrant init generic/ubuntu2204
```

```
vagrant up
```

```
vagrant ssh
```
