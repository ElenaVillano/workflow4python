# Notebooks

Notebooks are very easy to analyze data, check code, show results etc. 

You can install jupyter globally, but it gets kind of messy sometimes, so the suggestion is to install it inside a virtual environment. 

```
pip install notebook
```


# Code

To edit code you can use whichever editor you want to use. The important point is that whenever you run the code, you do it from the terminal with your virtual environment activated. 

- To code in Python use [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). The guidelines provided here are intended to improve the readability of code and make it consistent across the wide spectrum of Python code: “Readability counts”.

# Git and branches

Whenever you want to collaborate in a repo, make a new branch and work independently in that branch. Then you can merge the changes.

Also, the idea is that if you are going to collaborate to the main branch, do it in a cleaner way just changing one or two files so the person that is managing the repo can detect easily the new code that you want to implement. 

```
git switch <branch>
```


Important: 

```
git add <file>
```
